# ElectroCalc
## The Future of Car Searches

This web application was made to simplify car searching by providing the car best for the user based on their budget.

## How We Built It:

We built this web application using HTML5, CSS3, and JS.

## Challenges We Faced:
We faced a number of challenges while designing and building this web application, from constant change in the title, unable to access a car database, and restarting the whole project right before the deadline. We needed to find a way to provide data but we ended up hardcoding the information in a .json file.

## Future of ElectroCalc
In the future we hope to gain access to a car database in order to provide more vehicle descriptions and information for users.
